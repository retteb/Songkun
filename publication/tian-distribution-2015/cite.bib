 abstract = {In order to better understand the effects of urbanization on weed communities, the distribution of weed communities in Shanghai, China, was systematically investigated. The diversity of weed communities and four environmental factors, including the relative light intensity, soil moisture, soil compaction and soil pH, were measured in 1375 plots along an urban–rural gradient. The species diversity indices in each area along the urban–rural gradient were compared by using a one-way ANOVA. The weed communities were identified by using clustering methods that were based on relative dominance information. A canonical correspondence analysis was used to reveal the relationships between the species composition and the environmental factors at the community level and the Spearman's rank correlation test was used to test the relationship between the number of weed communities and each environmental factor. A total of 183 species, belonging to 41 families and 123 genera, was recorded. It was found that the species richness, Shannon–Wiener diversity index and Pielou evenness index followed a unimodal curve along the urban–rural gradient. The 1375 plots were divided into 133 weed community types. All four environmental factors significantly affected the species composition of the weed communities, but only soil compaction had significant effects on the number of weed communities. It was concluded that the diversification of habitat type and environmental change along the urban–rural gradient led to more weed communities in rural areas and fewer weed communities in urban areas. Based on the species' habitats and distribution patterns, the weeds were divided into “widespread”, “urban” and “rural”.},
