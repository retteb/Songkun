 abstract = {Much of the primary vegetation at low altitudes has been greatly altered or destroyed by a long history of human activities. This is particularly true in eastern China, where low-altitude areas are now dominated by secondary forests or plantations. Altitudinal vegetation zonation of this region is often based on these secondary forests, resulting in seral vegetation with an obscure zonal sequence. Here, we deduced the potential climax vegetation according to the regeneration patterns of the dominant species of the secondary forests at low altitudes (below 1,000 m a.s.l.) on Mt. Tianmu (1,506 m a.s.l., 30°18′30″–30°21′37″N, 119°24′11″–119°27′11″E). Based on the potential climax vegetation combined with the floristic composition and community structure, three vegetation zones were identified, viz: (1) evergreen broad-leaved forest zone (400–950 m a.s.l.); (2) evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest zone (950–1,100 m a.s.l.); (3) deciduous broad-leaved forest zone (1,100–1,506 m a.s.l.). The altitudinal vegetation zones identified in this study correspond with the thermal conditions on Mt. Tianmu. The distribution of vegetation on Mt. Tianmu was limited by lower temperatures in winter, and the altitudinal thermal vegetation zones on this mountain were more similar to the thermal vegetation of Japan than to that of China. The vertical distributions and roles of conifers were different between the eastern and the western regions along 30°N latitude in humid East Asia. Cryptomeria fortunei formed the emergent layer, towering above the broad-leaved canopy at middle altitudes as C. japonica on Yakushima, but disappeared at high altitudes with hydrothermal limitation on Mt. Tianmu.},
