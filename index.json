You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Math Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\n1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams.

It is endemic to southern China, central Vietnam, and eastern Laos, and today it is nearly extinct in the wild. Forest community characteristics and population structure of G. pensilis in China have remained unknown up to now. We investigated six swamp forest stands and analyzed their forest community characteristics (i.e. vertical stratification, species composition, and diversity) and population structure, including the frequency distribution of DBH (diameter at breast height) and age-classes as found in Fujian Province, southeastern China. The vertical stratifications of all the forest stands were rather simple. The remaining wild specimens ranged from roughly 15 to some 357 years for an average of ca. 85 years, with only a few individuals less than 20 years old. Compared with the stands and populations of G. pensilis in Vietnam, the taxonomic compositions of the stands in the two regions were different, except for the dominant species-G. pensilis. The Shannon–Wiener index showed the overstory of each stand had much lower diversity (0.26 on average) in Fujian Province than that (1.97 on average) in Vietnam, whereas the diversity indices were about the same (around 2.41) for the understories in the two regions. Furthermore, we discovered 18 G. pensilis seedlings at the study sites in Fujian Province. This discovery demonstrates that G. pensilis regeneration is extremely poor and its populations are declining, although these populations are relatively healthier than those in Vietnam.","tags":["Age-class","Fujian Province","Regeneration","Relict plant","Vietnam"],"title":"Forest characteristics and population structure of Glyptostrobus pensilis, a globally endangered relict species of southeastern China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yi Chong Cui","Kun Song","Xue Yan Guo","Peter M. van Bodegom","Ying Ji Pan","Zhi Hui Tian","Xiao Shuang Chen","Jie Wang","Liang Jun Da"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"44f510994624eca2b134c06350d26a8b","permalink":"/publication/cui-phylogenetic-2019/","publishdate":"2020-02-17T06:20:00.975938Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cui-phylogenetic-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Question Urbanization has remarkable impacts on the phylogenetic and functional structures of plant communities. Both temporal and spatial comparisons along urbanization gradients are widely used in related studies, but there has been a lack of consistency in the results. Moreover, there is a need for studies that determine species assembly mechanisms through immigration and extinction. Therefore, two questions were addressed: (a) How do the phylogenetic and functional structures of ruderal species respond to urbanization, and do their shifts follow a similar pattern along temporal and spatial urbanization gradients? (b) What are the key underlying processes, i.e., either extinction- or colonization-caused clustering, that determine the phylogenetic and functional structures of ruderal species under urbanization? Study site Two metropoles (Shanghai and Harbin) experiencing rapid urbanization in China. Methods We collected occurrence data on ruderal species from 1955 and the present in two cities. Standardized effect sizes of mean pairwise phylogenetic distance and of mean pairwise functional distance values (MPDSES and MFDSES, resp.) were calculated to test whether there was phylogenetic and/or functional structure clustering along spatial or temporal urbanization gradients. β-MPDSES and β-MFDSES values were used to quantify the similarities among colonists, extinct species, and residents. Results Along both the spatial and temporal gradients, the MPDSES values in each city decreased from significantly positive to significantly negative with increasing urbanization. Inconsistently, along the temporal gradients, the β-MPDSES values of the colonists/extinct species to the residents were significantly negative; along the spatial gradients, the β-MPDSES values of extinct species to residents were significantly positive with increasing urbanization. Conclusions We found there was a clear phylogenetic clustering of ruderal species with increasing spatial and temporal urbanization gradients. Our analysis showed that the changes across the urban–rural gradient are mainly driven by species going extinct that are phylogenetically dissimilar to the resident species. The temporal dynamics are, however, primarily driven by colonist species that are phylogenetically similar to the resident species.","tags":["colonists","extinction","invasive species","ruderal species","space-for-time substitution","urban plant community"],"title":"Phylogenetic and functional structures of plant communities along a spatiotemporal urbanization gradient: Effects of colonization and extinction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cindy Q.

We investigated the plant communities dominated by the dove tree Davidia involucrata in a nature reserve on Mount Jinfo, China, where people intensively manage large areas of bamboo stands. We found a significant lack of small-sized main stems of D. involucrata (0–25 cm diameter at breast height; height textgreater 1.3 m) and newly emerging sprouts in the reserve. The height-class distribution showed a unimodal pattern, with most individuals (of both D. involucrata and co-occurring species) concentrated in the 16–28 m height-class, and few individuals in the shrub and sub-canopy layer (1.3–8 m). Existing practices to facilitate the spread of bamboo stands, and the need to develop a local market for bamboo shoots received little consideration when the nature reserve was established in 1979 to protect D. involucrata. To conserve D. involucrata on Mount Jinfo the appropriate authorities and local parties involved in bamboo harvesting need to focus on methods that are favourable to the life history of this and other tree species, and strategies for their regeneration. These methods will also benefit the conservation of other highly valued trees that share similar life-history characteristics with D. involucrata.","tags":["Bamboo","China","Conservation effectiveness","Davidia involucrata","forest regeneration","Nyssaceae","protected areas","socio-ecological system"],"title":"Conservation and development in conflict: regeneration of wild Davidia involucrata (Nyssaceae) communities weakened by bamboo management in south-central China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kun Zhao","Lizhu Wang","Catherine Riseng","Kevin Wehrly","Yangdong Pan","Kun Song","Liangjun Da","Wanting Pang","Qingmin You","Hua Tian","Shuiqin Liu","Quanxi Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"4bacaa790878c473b6f9921fd8b94108","permalink":"/publication/zhao-factors-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-17T06:20:00.980927Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhao-factors-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Zooplankton play an important role in the pelagic food web as a mediator of nutrient and energy fluxes. Understanding factors determining zooplankton abundance, composition, and dispersal provides information needed for improving plankton dynamic predictions and enhancing effective water resource management and biodiversity conservation. We studied zooplankton dispersal and identified factors influence zooplankton composition and abundance under a unique in situ environment with four connected water types from the natural river to a man-made main canal, then interior canal-web, and finally lake that have different flow regimes. We found that, after seven years creation of the water system and zooplankton community development, the main canal, interior canal-web, and lake had 53%–64% zooplankton taxa similar to their water origin river but that each water type was represented and dominated by different zooplankton taxa. Our optimal model identified three key local factors that affected the difference in zooplankton abundance and composition among the four water types: Chlorophyll a concentration, turbidity, and salinity. We concluded that both zooplankton dispersal through watercourse and species sorting by local factors were important for structuring communities in our study system. Since most studies on dispersal and influence of local factors on zooplankton assemblages in new environment have been done largely in temporal ponds, our findings provide unique insights on how zooplankton communities are jointly regulated by their species dispersal origins and local environmental factors in newly created canals and lakes.","tags":["Connecting canal","Dispersal","Influential factor","Man-made lake","Zooplankton assemblage"],"title":"Factors determining zooplankton assemblage difference among a man-made lake, connecting canals, and the water-origin river","type":"publication"},{"authors":["希金 张","寒冰 冷","广琦 赵","军 景","爱翠 涂","坤 宋","良俊 达"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"670491af4f72605da3c5322c8de85d9a","permalink":"/publication/-4-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-17T06:20:00.983917Z","relpermalink":"/publication/-4-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"【目的】分析上海市4种常见绿化乔木杜英(Elaeocarpus decipiens)、女贞(Ligustrum lucidum)、黄山栾树(Koelreuteria bipinnata)、无患子(Sapindus mukorossi)木材密度随径级大小的变异。构建更适用城市生态系统的常用绿化乔木生物量模型,并验证木材密度与胸径的关系,为全面估算上海市绿化乔木生物量及碳储量奠定基础。【方法】采用Y=a Xb幂函数构建了生物量模型,汇总分析针对上海地区9种常见绿化乔木地上各器官生物量的模型,与此次研究构建的生物量模型进行比较,并讨论所建生物量模型的适用性。【结果】杜英树干密度显著小于其他3个树种,...","tags":["biomass model","greening tree species","Shanghai City","wood density","上海市","木材密度","生物量模型","绿化乔木"],"title":"上海4种常见绿化树种地上生物量模型构建","type":"publication"},{"authors":["俊丽 许","桂莲 张","希金 张","志文 高","启铖 仲","亚萍 张","坤 宋","良俊 达"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"3d33f90a500d0ae678d2ea6f6633c9b4","permalink":"/publication/-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-17T06:20:00.985949Z","relpermalink":"/publication/-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"人工林是城市具生命绿色基础设施的重要组成部分,土壤是人工林健康可持续发展的基础。在上海市域范围内选取5种主要人工林群落类型样地34个,分层采集0~100 cm土壤剖面样品,对人工林土壤理化性质与植物群落特征的相关性进行了研究。结果表明:(1)上海市人工林土壤容重偏高(1.07~1.67 g·cm~(-3)),土壤pH 5.7~8.3,土壤电导率(EC)为0.03~0.40 mS·cm~(-1),碱解氮(5.4~183.4 mg·kg~(-1)),有效磷(1.4~80.5 mg·kg~(-1))和有机质(3.33~42.88 g·kg~(-1))相对匮乏;土壤pH值、碱解氮和有机质随土层加深表现...","tags":["age group","forest plantations","forest soil science","forest type","physical and chemical properties","soil","人工林","土壤","森林土壤学","植被类型","理化性质","龄组"],"title":"上海市人工林土壤理化性质与群落特征的相关性","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JunLi Xu","BeiBei Jing","KaiXuan Zhang","YiChong Cui","Dan Malkinson","Daniella Kopel","Kun Song","LiangJun Da"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506816000,"objectID":"cd5acdf168942661693e58570fd50158","permalink":"/publication/xu-heavy-2017/","publishdate":"2020-02-17T06:20:00.988904Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xu-heavy-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The heavy metal (HM) pollution of forest soil has been known as one of the most challenging pollution issues due to their characteristics.

Spatial factors (e.g., river connectivity, directionality, and man-made dams) may play a key role in influencing the metacommunity structure of rotifers because of their small body size and weak mobility. In contrast, local environmental factors (e.g., physicochemical habitat) may be more important to crustaceans due to their larger body size and stronger mobility. We sampled zooplankton and environmental factors during wet and dry seasons from 47 sites along the Ying River in China to assess the roles of the spatial and environmental factors in structuring zooplankton metacommunities. We used Moran’s eigenvector map and asymmetric eigenvector map to model the influences of river connectivity, directionality, and man-made dams on zooplankton metacommunity structure. We then used partial redundancy analysis to identify individual and interactive effects of spatial and environmental factors on both the entire zooplankton assemblages and two zooplankton groups of different body sizes and mobility. A total of 101 taxa were identified and taxa richness was higher in the wet season (72) than in the dry season (58). Zooplankton assemblages were primarily dominated by rotifers. For the dry season, environmental factors such as total nitrogen, water temperature, and pH explained a significant portion of variation in zooplankton community; river connectivity was more important than river directionality to zooplankton metacommunity structure. For the wet season, spatial factors were more influential than environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen and water transparency; river directionality played an important role in influencing the spatial structures of both environmental condition and zooplankton metacommunity. We also found significant effects of man-made dams on zooplankton metacommunity structure. Spatial factors are more influential in structuring small body size and weak mobility rotifer communities, while environmental factors are more important in determining the variation of crustaceans due to their larger body size and stronger mobility. We concluded that river connectivity and directionality should be considered as key factors for better understanding the spatial processes of planktonic passive dispersers in river networks. Our study provides new insight on understanding riverine zooplankton metacommunity ecology and contributes to the knowledge of river ecosystem health monitoring and management.","tags":["Dams","Dispersal","River connectivity and directionality","Variation partitioning","Zooplankton metacommunity structure"],"title":"Metacommunity structure of zooplankton in river networks: Roles of environmental and spatial factors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kun Song","Yichong Cui","Xijin Zhang","Yingji Pan","Junli Xu","Kaiqin Xu","Liangjun Da"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"5312d190fd1f0e52dbd371a1beb782e8","permalink":"/publication/song-enhanced-2017/","publishdate":"2020-02-17T06:20:00.987906Z","relpermalink":"/publication/song-enhanced-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Water eutrophication creates unfavorable environmental conditions for submerged macrophytes. In these situations, biotic interactions may be particularly important for explaining and predicting the submerged macrophytes occurrence. Here, we evaluate the roles of biotic interactions in predicting spatial occurrence of submerged macrophytes in 1959 and 2009 for Dianshan Lake in eastern China, which became eutrophic since the 1980s. For the four common species occurred in 1959 and 2009, null species distribution models based on abiotic variables and full models based on both abiotic and biotic variables were developed using generalized linear model (GLM) and boosted regression trees (BRT) to determine whether the biotic variables improved the model performance. Hierarchical Bayesian-based joint species distribution models capable of detecting paired biotic interactions were established for each species in both periods to evaluate the changes in the biotic interactions. In most of the GLM and BRT models, the full models showed better performance than the null models in predicting the species presence/absence, and the relative importance of the biotic variables in the full models increased from less than 50% in 1959 to more than 50% in 2009 for each species. Moreover, co-occurrence correlation of each paired species interaction was higher in 2009 than that in 1959. The findings suggest biotic interactions that tend to be positive play more important roles in the spatial distribution of multispecies assemblages of macrophytes and should be included in prediction models to improve prediction accuracy when forecasting macrophytes’ distribution under eutrophication stress.","tags":["aquatic plants","facilitation","freshwater lakes","species distribution model"],"title":"Enhanced effects of biotic interactions on predicting multispecies spatial distribution of submerged macrophytes after eutrophication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["永昌 宋","恩荣 阎","坤 宋"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"b42254f2de6d9f6228c1dc0fd349f7f9","permalink":"/publication/-2017/","publishdate":"2020-02-17T06:20:00.992572Z","relpermalink":"/publication/-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"在《对中国植被分类系统的认知和建议》(简称《认知和建议》)的基础上,参考近期国内外植被分类研究成果,再次讨论了中国植被分类系统和单位,统一了各级单位划分依据,增补了高、中、低各等级分类的具体建议,并对《认知和建议》一文中相关部分,特别是植被型一级做了修订。将该修订方案与联合国教科文组织《世界植被分类与制图》、美国联邦地理数据委员会《美国植被分类规范》,以及Braun-Blanquet的分类方案进行对比,以便于同行间相互了解和交流。","tags":["association","formation","suggested scheme","vegetation classification","vegetation type","建议方案","植被分类","植被型","群丛","群系"],"title":"再议中国的植被分类系统","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Due to its wide extent, the EDF ecotone was usually treated as an independent vegetation zone in China. In this chapter, we summarize historical debates about its zonal vegetation and boundaries, and present new perspectives based on a case study that considers effects of topography on the vegetation transition pattern across the EDF ecotone. The case study showed that topographic differentiation in the forest transition pattern from evergreen to deciduous forest occurred in both latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, causing a hierarchical transition process in three dimensions. Based on these results, a mosaic transition pattern across the EDF ecotone is proposed, with more and larger evergreen patches toward the south and more and larger deciduous patches toward the north. This could result in stable mixed evergreen-deciduous broad-leaved forests in the transition areas between evergreen and deciduous patches. Finally, by comparing climate-vegetation relationships in China and Japan, we discuss the formation mechanism of the EDF ecotone and offer a new proposal for its boundary determination, based on these new perspectives.","tags":null,"title":"Evergreen-Deciduous Broad-Leaved Forest Ecotone in Eastern China: Retrospect and New Perspectives","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"\rR Markdown\rThis is an R Markdown document.

The diversity of weed communities and four environmental factors, including the relative light intensity, soil moisture, soil compaction and soil pH, were measured in 1375 plots along an urban–rural gradient. The species diversity indices in each area along the urban–rural gradient were compared by using a one-way ANOVA. The weed communities were identified by using clustering methods that were based on relative dominance information. A canonical correspondence analysis was used to reveal the relationships between the species composition and the environmental factors at the community level and the Spearman's rank correlation test was used to test the relationship between the number of weed communities and each environmental factor. A total of 183 species, belonging to 41 families and 123 genera, was recorded. It was found that the species richness, Shannon–Wiener diversity index and Pielou evenness index followed a unimodal curve along the urban–rural gradient. The 1375 plots were divided into 133 weed community types. All four environmental factors significantly affected the species composition of the weed communities, but only soil compaction had significant effects on the number of weed communities. It was concluded that the diversification of habitat type and environmental change along the urban–rural gradient led to more weed communities in rural areas and fewer weed communities in urban areas. Based on the species' habitats and distribution patterns, the weeds were divided into “widespread”, “urban” and “rural”.","tags":["diversity pattern","growth form","life form","weed management","weed types"],"title":"Distribution patterns and traits of weed communities along an urban–rural gradient under rapid urbanization in Shanghai, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["永昌 宋","恩荣 阎","坤 宋"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"21eec7ea2d2172eebb43c484a5ddc534","permalink":"/publication/-8-2015/","publishdate":"2020-02-17T06:20:00.996836Z","relpermalink":"/publication/-8-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"本文通过汇总中国常绿阔叶林8大动态监测样地的植物名录,在规整植物名称的基础上,统计了8大样地的植物种类组成,比较了它们的相似性及其与环境立地的关系。利用生长型和生态指示值,分析了8大样地组成植物的生态特征及其与生境的联系。从区系组成和生态特征看,8大样地可分为两组,一组包括天童、古田山、百山祖、八大公山,属于典型常绿阔叶林;另一组包括黑石顶、鼎湖山、福山、莲花池,属于季节常绿阔叶林和适雨常绿阔叶林(亚热带雨林)。另外还讨论了动态观测样地的群落类型划分问题。最后提出的建议是:增加草本和藤本植物调查,重视植物分类和生态指示值及种间相互关系的研究,更为重要的是制定长期的协作研究计划。","tags":["community classification","ecological characteristics","ecological indicatior value","evergreen broadleaf forest","floristic composition","区系组成","常绿阔叶林","生态指示值","生态特征","群落分类"],"title":"中国常绿阔叶林8大动态监测样地植被的综合比较","type":"publication"},{"authors":["婷 蔡","阿瑾 李","坤 宋","良俊 达","开钦 徐","爱玲 燕"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"d78ad432ea815212ecd4f5b6372cf158","permalink":"/publication/-2015/","publishdate":"2020-02-17T06:20:00.997833Z","relpermalink":"/publication/-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"以上海黄浦江上游水源涵养林为研究对象,选择近自然混交林、香樟(Cinnamomum camphora)人工纯林和无患子(Sapindus mukorossi)人工纯林,对比了地上部分、枯落物层、土壤层三个垂直层次的持水量,综合评价了其水源涵养功能。结果表明:地上部分持水量近自然混交林与香樟纯林持平,大于无患子纯林,分别为16.36t/hm2,16.85t/hm2,12.54t/hm2;枯落物层最大持水量依次为近自然混交林(0.37t/hm2)\u0026gt;无患子纯林(0.004t/hm2)\u0026gt;香樟纯林(0.003t/hm2);土壤层最大持水量近自然混交林(2 657.02t/hm2)\u0026gt;无患子纯林(2 526...","tags":["canopy interception","near-natural forest","soil physical properties","water conservation","water-holding capacity of litter","土壤物理性质","林冠截留","枯落物持水","水源涵养","近自然混交林"],"title":"黄浦江上游近自然混交林和人工纯林水源涵养功能评价","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kun Song","Takashi S.

In ecotones, which are sensitive to environmental variation, this effect on vegetation differentiation may be magnified at a regional scale. Here, we evaluate vegetation transition patterns across an evergreen–deciduous broad-leaved forest ecotone (EDF ecotone) in eastern China, to investigate whether the transition pattern differs between two topographic positions with different habitats, and identify underlying environmental mechanisms driving variation in species- and trait-based community structure. Location Anhui Province, China. Methods Across an EDF ecotone, community data were collected in 47 20 × 20-m plots situated on upper and lower hill slopes. Trait-based community structure was constructed based on seven functional traits and weighted by species abundance. Environmental variables were grouped into three categories: thermal conditions, water availability and edaphic variables. Trends in species richness and dominance along latitude were evaluated for both evergreen broad-leaved species (EBT) and deciduous broad-leaved species (DBT). Variation partitioning analysis was used to distinguish the roles of the three environmental variables in determining transition patterns within the two topographies. Results For both EBT and DBT, species richness showed similar transition patterns along the latitudinal gradient on both the upper and the lower slope. However, species dominance changed more abruptly on the upper than on the lower slope. Compared with edaphic variables, both thermal conditions and water availability had a larger impact on transitions across the EDF ecotone, but their relative roles differed between the upper and the lower slopes. Thermal conditions primarily explained the variation in species- and trait-based community structure on the upper slope, while water availability primarily explained variation on the lower slope. Conclusions Our results suggest different roles of thermal conditions and water availability in determining transition patterns between the two topographies. Evergreen Castanopsis trees, having less cold tolerance, make transitions on the upper slope more sensitive to thermal conditions. Cyclobalanopsis trees, which prefer wet habitats, make the transition on the lower slope more sensitive to water availability. Based on the present findings, we predict that the EDF ecotone will become narrower and there will be a sharper boundary between the evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forests of eastern China under warmer and drier climate conditions.","tags":["Biome boundary","Climate change","Eastern China","Functional traits","Variation partitioning"],"title":"Transition patterns across an evergreen–deciduous broad-leaved forest ecotone: the effect of topographies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ti-Yuan Xia","Jun-ying Wang","Kun Song","Liang-jun Da"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"ab2a81b029eddb813dc58bda6592eedc","permalink":"/publication/xia-variations-2014/","publishdate":"2020-02-17T06:20:01.002827Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xia-variations-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Shanghai is the largest commercial and industrial city of China, but air quality issues have hindered its development in becoming a “global city.” This study used monitoring data on SO2, NO x , acid rain pH, dustfall, and total suspended particles (TSP) from the Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center to evaluate and analyze the air quality in urban, suburban, and rural areas during the period 1983–2005.

For the entire region of Shanghai, the relationship between the integrated air quality index and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was an N-shaped environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) due to decreasing air quality in suburban and rural areas this century.

The disturbances were inferred from tree-ring growth release and long-term establishment patterns obtained from 91 overstory trees. The initial growth rates of these trees were compared to trees originating in the understory to evaluate the intensity of past disturbances. The spatial distribution patterns of disturbances were portrayed with tree mapping. The results revealed that there were five disturbances, averaging one disturbance per decade over the past half century. The first disturbance event was probably most intense given that most canopy trees established at that time and displayed high initial growth rates. The timing of the second disturbance event coincided with the documented selective logging. The last three disturbances, having lower tree growth responses and a clumped spatial distribution of gap creation, were probably the result of recurring typhoons. The first two disturbances led to tree regeneration and secondary succession, represented mainly by long-lived deciduous trees in the forest. The subsequent disturbances facilitated the stand development process, creating a complex three-dimensional structure from a pre-existing single-age cohort. This study suggests that EBLFs affected by large disturbances can recover in a few decades and the frequent gap disturbances probably facilitate its process in the early successional stages.","tags":["Dendroecology","Disturbance history","Growth release","Typhoon"],"title":"The spatio-temporal pattern of historical disturbances of an evergreen broadleaved forest in East China: a dendroecological analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["坤 宋","文 孙","良俊 达"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"efee54eea84de97f58fb0d76d23fbe1a","permalink":"/publication/-2011/","publishdate":"2020-02-17T06:20:01.007461Z","relpermalink":"/publication/-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"通过年轮分析,构建了浙江天童米槠-木荷林优势种木荷、米槠、石栎的年龄结构,分析了高生长和径向生长及萌枝策略随年龄的变化规律,探讨了干扰对群落动态的影响。研究结果表明:(1)3个物种的胸径、高度与年龄的关系均可用logistic曲线和线性模型拟合,但随年龄增加胸径、高度与年龄的关系显著下降。(2)随年龄增加3树种的DBH/H逐渐增加,米槠、石栎幼龄个体(1—20a)的有萌个体率和有萌个体萌枝数逐渐下降;米槠和石栎幼苗的主干较木荷细长、多萌枝,木荷和石栎成树主干较米槠细长;体现了米槠的更新策略具开拓性,木荷的具保守性,石栎在幼龄期具开拓性,成年期转为保守性。(3)米槠和石栎的年龄结构呈逆J型,幼龄...","tags":["community dynamics","evergreen broadleaved forest","regeneration type","tree-ring","常绿阔叶林","更新类型","树木年轮","群落动态"],"title":"米槠-木荷林优势种群的年龄结构及其更新策略","type":"publication"},{"authors":["TongHui Yang","Kun Song","LiangJun Da","XiuPeng Li","JianPing Wu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1277942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1277942400,"objectID":"21e66c96980b6e3fa0333b9bf56ec4bf","permalink":"/publication/yang-biomass-2010/","publishdate":"2020-02-17T06:20:01.003981Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yang-biomass-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"The biomass and productivity of Schima superba-Castanopsis carlesii forests in Tiantong, Zhejiang Province, were determined using overlapping quadrants and stem analyses.

About 87.2% of biomass existed in the tree layer. The resprouting biomass was small, of which over 95.0% occurred in the shrub layer. The productivity of the aboveground parts of the community was (386.8±98.9) g m−2a−1, in which more than 96.0% was present at the tree level. The trunk’s contribution to productivity was the greatest, while that of leaves was the smallest. In China, the community biomass of subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests differs significantly with the age of the forest. The community biomass of the 52-year-old S. superba-C. carlesii forests in this study was lower than the average biomass of subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests in China, and was lower than the biomass of other subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests elsewhere in the world. Moreover, its productivity was lower than the model estimate, indicating that without disturbance, this community has great developmental potential in terms of community biomass and productivity.","tags":["community biomass","distribution pattern","evergreen broadleaved forest","net primary productivity","Schima superba-Castanopsis carlesii community"],"title":"The biomass and aboveground net primary productivity of Schima superba-Castanopsis carlesii forests in east China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liang-Jun Da","Min-Ming Kang","Kun Song","Kan-Kan Shang","Yong-Chuan Yang","Ai-Mei Xia","Yu-Feng Qi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1243814400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1243814400,"objectID":"3138ea4f1d4badc6fd8342878ffb746c","permalink":"/publication/da-altitudinal-2009/","publishdate":"2020-02-17T06:20:01.005975Z","relpermalink":"/publication/da-altitudinal-2009/","section":"publication","summary":"Much of the primary vegetation at low altitudes has been greatly altered or destroyed by a long history of human activities. This is particularly true in eastern China, where low-altitude areas are now dominated by secondary forests or plantations. Altitudinal vegetation zonation of this region is often based on these secondary forests, resulting in seral vegetation with an obscure zonal sequence. Here, we deduced the potential climax vegetation according to the regeneration patterns of the dominant species of the secondary forests at low altitudes (below 1,000 m a.s.l.) on Mt. Tianmu (1,506 m a.s.l., 30°18′30″–30°21′37″N, 119°24′11″–119°27′11″E). Based on the potential climax vegetation combined with the floristic composition and community structure, three vegetation zones were identified, viz: (1) evergreen broad-leaved forest zone (400–950 m a.s.l.); (2) evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest zone (950–1,100 m a.s.l.); (3) deciduous broad-leaved forest zone (1,100–1,506 m a.s.l.). The altitudinal vegetation zones identified in this study correspond with the thermal conditions on Mt. Tianmu. The distribution of vegetation on Mt. Tianmu was limited by lower temperatures in winter, and the altitudinal thermal vegetation zones on this mountain were more similar to the thermal vegetation of Japan than to that of China. The vertical distributions and roles of conifers were different between the eastern and the western regions along 30°N latitude in humid East Asia. Cryptomeria fortunei formed the emergent layer, towering above the broad-leaved canopy at middle altitudes as C. japonica on Yakushima, but disappeared at high altitudes with hydrothermal limitation on Mt. Tianmu.","tags":["Cryptomeria","Diameter distribution","Potential climax vegetation","Regeneration pattern","Secondary forest"],"title":"Altitudinal zonation of human-disturbed vegetation on Mt.

Data on monitored cross-sections were collected from the Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center. The results indicated that the spatial pattern of surface water quality was determined by the level of urbanization. Surface water qualities in urban and suburban areas were improved by strengthening the environmental policies and management, but were worsening in rural areas. The relationship between economic growth and surface water quality in Shanghai showed an inversed-U-shaped curve, which reflected a similar pattern in most developed countries.

Here, we explore its land-use and land-cover changes, focusing on the impacts of the urbanization process on air and water quality, local climate, and biodiversity. Over the past 30 years, Shanghai's urban area and green land (eg urban parks, street trees, lawns) have increased dramatically, at the expense of cropland. Concentrations of major air pollutants (eg SO2, NOx, and total suspended particles) were higher in urban areas than in suburban and rural areas. Overall, however, concentrations have decreased (with the exception of NOx), due primarily to a decline in coal consumption by industry and in private households. Increased NOx pollution was mainly attributed to the huge increase in the number of vehicles on the roads. Water quality changes showed a pattern similar to that of air quality, with the most severe pollution occurring in urban areas. Differences in mean air temperatures between urban and rural areas also increased, in line with the rapid pace of urban expansion, indicating an accelerating “urban heat island” effect. Urban expansion also led to a decrease in native plant species. Despite its severe environmental problems, Shanghai has also seen major economic development. Managing the tradeoffs between urbanization and environmental protection will be a major challenge for Chinese policy makers.","tags":null,"title":"Ecological consequences of rapid urban expansion: Shanghai, China","type":"publication"}]
